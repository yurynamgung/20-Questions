# 20-Questions

Plays a game of 20 Questions where it guesses what object/topic/event
the player is thinking of. It asks a series of questions and when it cannot
guess the user's answer, it learns from the user so that it can correctly guess 
next time. 

Each game can be saved, which preserves the new information the player taught 
to the program in that game.
